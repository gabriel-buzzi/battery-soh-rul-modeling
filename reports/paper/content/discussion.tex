Results Discussion and Methodology Limitations

Voltage and Capacity normalization to ensure multi-cell interoperability. On this work wouldn't make sense since all cells are the same type.
Voltage Min-Max Normalization with voltage cutoff as well. 
Current Min-Max Normalization with current cutoff would depend on the charger and load.
