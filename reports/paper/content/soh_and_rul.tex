\section{State-of-Health (SoH) and Remaining Useful Life (RUL)}

How both are calculated on this dataset: 

\[ SoH_n = \frac{\text{Max Discharge Capacity of nth Cycle}}{\text{Rated Cell Capacity}} \]

\[ EoL = \text{Cycle when SoH is 80\%} \]

\[ RUL_n = EoL - n \]

RUL limitation of being define by cycle count: real-world applications don't have well defined cycles.

SOH ground truth limitation: rarely a cell undergoes full charge on real life.

RUL ground truth limitation: need data from fully aged cells to know it.
