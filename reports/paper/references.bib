  abstract  = "Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion
               batteries is crucial for enhancing their reliability and safety.
               Addressing the issue of inaccurate RUL predictions caused by the
               nonlinear decay resulting from capacity regeneration, this paper
               proposes an indirect lithium-ion battery RUL prediction method
               based on complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with
               adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and convolutional neural network
               (CNN)--bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU). The method
               extracts Health Indicators (HI) from the battery-charging stage
               and employs CEEMDAN to decompose HI into several components.
               These components are then input into a component prediction
               model for forecasting. Finally, the predicted component results
               are fused and input into a capacity prediction model to achieve
               indirect RUL prediction. Validation is conducted using the
               lithium-ion battery dataset provided by NASA. The results
               indicate that, under prediction starting points (STs) of 80 and
               100, the maximum average absolute errors do not exceed 0.0096
               and 0.0081, and the maximum root mean square errors do not
               exceed 0.0196 and 0.0115, demonstrating high precision and
               reliability.",

  abstract  = "For a lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery to operate safely and
               reliably, an accurate state of health (SOH) estimation is
               crucial. Data-driven models with manual feature extraction are
               commonly used for battery SOH estimation, requiring extensive
               expert knowledge to extract features. In this regard, a novel
               data pre-processing model is proposed in this paper to extract
               health-related features automatically from battery-discharging
               data for SOH estimation. In the proposed method, one-dimensional
               (1D) voltage data are converted to two-dimensional (2D) data,
               and a new data set is created using a 2D sliding window. Then,
               features are automatically extracted in the machine learning
               (ML) training process. Finally, the estimation of the SOH is
               achieved by forecasting the battery voltage in the subsequent
               cycle. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated on
               the NASA public data set for a Li-ion battery degradation
               analysis in four different scenarios. The simulation results
               show a considerable reduction in the RMSE of battery SOH
               estimation. The proposed method eliminates the need for the
               manual extraction and evaluation of features, which is an
               important step toward automating the SOH estimation process and
               developing battery digital twins.",
